# SHy
Implementation for the paper: Self-Explaining Hypergraph Neural Networks for Diagnosis Prediction.

This repository contains code only. MIMIC raw files, preprocessed arrays, checkpoints, and training logs are intentionally excluded from Git.

## Requirements
- Python 3.9.13
- PyTorch 1.13.1
- torch_scatter 2.1.0+pt113cu116
- torch_sparse 0.6.16+pt113cu116
- torch_geometric 2.2.0
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Install the Python packages listed above with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Linux note:
- `torch_scatter`, `torch_sparse`, and `torch_geometric` must be installed with builds that match your PyTorch and CUDA/CPU environment.

## Data Downloading and Preprocessing
First, make the following directories:
- `./data/RAW/MIMIC_III`
- `./data/MIMIC_III`
- `./data/MIMIC_IV/binary_test_x_slices`
- `./data/MIMIC_IV/binary_train_x_slices`
### Experiments on MIMIC-III
Download the following MIMIC-III data files from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/) to the directory `./data/RAW/MIMIC_III`:
- ADMISSIONS.csv
- DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv
- D_ICD_DIAGNOSES.csv

Run the preprocessing notebook for MIMIC-III: `./notebooks/iii_preprocessing.ipynb`.

### Experiments on MIMIC-IV
Download the following MIMIC-IV data files from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/1.0/) to the directory `./data/RAW/MIMIC_IV`:
- admissions.csv
- diagnoses_icd.csv
- d_icd_diagnoses.csv

Run the preprocessing notebook for MIMIC-IV: `./notebooks/iv_preprocessing.ipynb`.

## Model Training and Evaluation
First, make the following directories:
- `./saved_models`
- `./training_logs`
All Python entry points below are cross-platform and can be run from the project root on Linux, macOS, or Windows.

Recommended:
```bash
python -m shy.main ...
```

Legacy `python main.py` from inside `./shy` also still works.
### Experiments on MIMIC-III
From the project root, run:
```bash
python -u -m shy.main --temperature 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 --add_ratio 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 --loss_weight 1.0 0.003 0.00025 0.0 0.04
```
The model checkpoint at each epoch will be saved in `./saved_models`. When the training is done, the results will be saved in `./training_logs`.

### Experiments on MIMIC-IV
From the project root, run:
```bash
python -u -m shy.main --dataset_name MIMIC_IV --temperature 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 --add_ratio 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.2 --loss_weight 1.0 0.003 0.00025 0.0 0.04
```
The model checkpoint at each epoch will be saved in `./saved_models`. When the training is done, the results will be saved in `./training_logs`.

Linux note:
- MIMIC-III raw filenames are case-sensitive on Linux. Keep them exactly as `ADMISSIONS.csv`, `DIAGNOSES_ICD.csv`, and `D_ICD_DIAGNOSES.csv`.

## Choosing Optimal Hyperparameters
The table below presents the final hyperparameters used on each dataset, including the range of considered values. These hyperparameters were determined through grid search.

| Hyperparameters | MIMIC-III | MIMIC-IV | Search Range |
| --------        | --------  | -------- | --------     |
| $d_c$           | 32        | 32       | [16, 32]     |
| $Z$             | 2         | 2        | [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]  |
| $d_c^{(1)}$     | 1024      | 1024     | [256, 512, 1024] |
| $d_c^{(2)}$     | 128       | 128      | [128]     |
| $n_s$           | 10        | 10       | [10, 20]     |
| $p$             | 0.2       | 0.2      | [0.2]     |
| $K$             | 5         | 5        | [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]    |
| $d_{hid}$       | 128       | 256      | [128, 256]     |
| $d_Q$           | 256       | 256      | [256]     |
| $d_V$           | 256       | 256      | [256]     |
| $\epsilon$      | 0.003     | 0.003    | [0.003]     |
| $\eta$          | 0.00025   | 0.0002   | [0.0002, 0.00025, 0.0003] |
